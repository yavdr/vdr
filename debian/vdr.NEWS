vdr (2.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dropped plugins dvbsddevice, hddevice and rcu from vdr source package

vdr (2.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now using /etc/vdr/conf.d for loading plugins

  VDR plugin packages now install a config file to /etc/vdr/conf.avail/.
  This is basically the same as the old config file
  /etc/vdr/plugins/plugin-<name>.conf and contains contains the command line
  arguments passed to the plugin.
  By creating a symlink in /etc/vdr.conf.d/ which points to the config in
  conf.avail/ the plugin gets enabled for loading when the vdr daemon is
  started.

  * Support for multiple video directories dropped

  The code for distributing recordings over several video directories has been
  removed. VDR now by default assumes that the video directory is one big disk.
  It is recommended to use e.g. mhddfs or LVM to combine multiple volumes.

  The default video directory for VDR now is /var/lib/video. This can be changed
  by modifying the --video setting in /etc/vdr/conf.d/00-vdr.conf.

vdr (1.7.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed Full Featured DVB card support

  Starting with VDR 1.7 support for full featured DVB cards (the ones with
  built-in SDTV video output) requires one to install an extra plug-in provided
  by the vdr-plugin-dvbsddevice package.

  Please also note, that proper trick speed playback with a full featured DVB
  card needs an improved av7110 firmware. Without this firmware you might
  experience problems like jumping backwards when stopping fast-forward playback.
  The improved firmware is provided by Oliver Endriss and can be download here:

  * Dropped vdr-* scripts

  The vdr-daemon, vdr-lirc and vdr-rcu wrapper scripts as well as the vdr-kbd
  binary have been removed from the package. Please use /use/bin/vdr with the
  options "--no-kbd", "--lirc" and "--rcu" instead.

vdr (1.4.7-1) experimental; urgency=low

  The script /usr/lib/vdr/vdr-groups.sh may now be used by plugins to
  manage the group memberships of the user 'vdr'. See README.Debian
  for details on how to use this script.
  
  If you manually need to add the user 'vdr' to a group, you should
  add the group name to /etc/vdr/vdr-groups. This way the vdr-groups.sh
  script used by plugin installation/deinstallation procedures does
  not try to remove vdr from this group.

vdr (1.2.6-9) experimental; urgency=low

  This release adds a patch which allows us to have just one binary-
  package for all four control-methods, so we do not need the 
  packages vdr-daemon, vdr-kbd, vdr-lirc and vdr-rcu anymore. 
  You can run vdr with the control-method you want by calling 
  /usr/bin/vdr-{daemon,kbd,lirc,rcu} or by using 
  
  update-alternatives --config vdr

  and setting it to the desired control-method. (lirc is default)
  After this a call of /usr/bin/vdr will always use the control-
  method you selected with update-alternatives.

vdr (1.2.6-6) unstable; urgency=low

  The most important change in this release is that vdr from now on
  will run under the username vdr, not as root. This is due to some
  security problems when vdr runs as root. The video-directory and 
  configfiles will be changed at installation, so they are owned by 
  the user and group vdr.

  The second thing is that the automatic shutdown of vdr is now disabled
  by default, you can enable it again by changing ENABLE_SHUTDOWN to 1 
  in /etc/default/vdr.
  
  In this release we also changed the default VIDEO_DIR from 
  /var/lib/video to /var/lib/video.00, to make adding extra harddisks 
  for vdr very easy by just creating /var/lib/video.0{1,2,3,...} and 
  mounting the drive(s) there. In existing installations we will simply 
  create a symlink /var/lib/video.00 which points to /var/lib/video. In 
  new installations /var/lib/video will be a symlink which points to 
  /var/lib/video.00. (These changes will only be asked for when you 
  selected yes in the debconf-question to create the video-directory!)

vdr (1.2.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  This is the first release from the VDR and DVB Packaging Team
  <pkg-vdr-dvb-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>
  Many thanks to Tobias Grimm and Thomas GÃ¼nther for the various improvements
  of the package.

  In this Release, we changed the path of the conf-files to /var/lib/vdr,
  static conf-files will still be under /etc/vdr, and symlinked to
  /var/lib/vdr. 
  If you already have non-static files (channels.conf, remote.conf, 
  setup.conf and timers.conf), these files will be moved by the 
  postinst-script to /var/lib/vdr.

  The most important change in this release is the new init-system of vdr,
  which was taken from c't-vdr, a woody-based distribution, optimized for vdr.
    - Plugins are no longer loaded via /etc/default/vdr. Instead of this,
      every installed plugin will be loaded automatically. The order of the
      plugins can be configured via /etc/vdr/plugins/order.conf.
    - The commands.conf and the reccmds.conf files will be auto-generated 
      by the init-script for better integration of vdr-addons.
      If you already have a commands.conf or reccmds.conf, you should move it
      to /etc/vdr/command-hooks/{commands|reccmds}.custom.conf .
